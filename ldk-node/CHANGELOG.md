# 0.1.0 - Jun 22, 2023
This is the first non-experimental release of LDK Node.

- Log files are now split based on the start date of the node (#116).
- Support for allowing inbound trusted 0conf channels has been added (#69).
- Non-permanently connected peers are now included in `Node::list_peers` (#95).
- A utility method for generating a BIP39 mnemonic is now exposed in bindings (#113).
- A `ChannelConfig` may now be specified on channel open or updated afterwards (#122).
- Logging has been improved and `Builder` now returns an error rather than panicking if encountering a build failure (#119).
- In Rust, `Builder::build` now returns a `Node` object rather than wrapping it in an `Arc` (#115).
- A number of `Config` defaults have been updated and are now exposed in bindings (#124).
- The API has been updated to be more aligned between Rust and bindings (#114).

## Compatibility Notes
- Our currently supported minimum Rust version (MSRV) is 1.60.0.
- The superfluous `SendingFailed` payment status has been removed, breaking serialization compatibility with alpha releases (#125).
- The serialization formats of `PaymentDetails` and `Event` types have been updated, ensuring users upgrading from an alpha release fail to start rather than continuing operating with bogus data. Alpha users should wipe their persisted payment metadata (`payments/*`) and event queue (`events`) after the update (#130).
